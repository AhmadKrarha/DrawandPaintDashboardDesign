# Draw and Paint Dashboard

This is a simple Windows Forms application built with .NET 6 and C# 10.0. The project provides a basic drawing dashboard where users can draw rectangles and circles on a canvas, choose their color, and adjust the size of the shapes.

## Features

- **Draw Rectangle:** Click the "Draw Rectangle" button to draw a filled rectangle on the canvas.
- **Draw Circle:** Click the "Draw Circle" button to draw a filled circle on the canvas.
- **Choose Color:** Select any color for your shapes using the color picker dialog.
- **Adjust Size:** Use the numeric up-down control to set the size of the shapes (from 10 to 200 pixels).

## How It Works

- The main form (`MainForm.cs`) contains a canvas panel and controls for drawing shapes, selecting colors, and adjusting size.
- When you click a draw button, the selected shape is drawn on the canvas with the chosen color and size.
- The color dialog allows you to pick any color for your shapes.
- The numeric up-down control lets you set the size of the shapes dynamically.
